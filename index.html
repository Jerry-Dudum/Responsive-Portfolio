                Hello, my name is Jerry Dudum but the picture you see is of my dog, Rocky. I put him there because I
                love
                dogs so much and he's been with me for most of my life and is a big part of it. Welcome to my first
                basic
                portfolio website where I'm showcasing breifly my newfound skills in both html and css.

            <p class="summary">
                I decided to attend the UCB Coding Bootcamp because I love technology and problem solving and was
                seeking to
                switch career paths because web development and programming is a huge interest of mine. Problem solving
                is
                something I always loved to do and it is always present within coding. Also I've been hooked on
                computers
                ever since I was 5 years old and have even built over 6 customs gaming PCs for my self and various
                friends.
                I decided it was time to take the leap of faith and get out of my comfort zone and this is where my
                journey
                begins.
